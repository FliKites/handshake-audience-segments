# handshake-audience-segments
This is a *ongoing* experiment to identify the different audience segments that exist within the Handshake Blockchain Ecosystem.


# Handshake Cohorts:

- Name Speculation:

 
    - - The Botter: Someone who wants to gain a competeitive advantage in winning Handshake Auctions/Names, by using automated techniques. (related to resale)

    - - The Collector: Someone who wants to own a specific Handshake name for their collection (in most cases related to resale but could also be personal)

    - - The Accumulator: Someone who buys up specific Handshake names often, that they plan to use in the future.

    - - The Seller: Someone who makes it a goal to sell Second Level Handshake domain names on top of a Handshake TLD they own. 
         (ex.) http://b.ez (Namecheap, Porkbun, Encirca)

    - - The Builder: Someone who wants to own a specific Handshake name that they could use to build something publicly available on the internet. 
         (in most cases to build brand equity within the ecosystem for its larger adoption, but in some cases the intention is to profit, or host personal content)

    - - The Dabbler: Someone who is introduced to handshake in one way or another, and decided to "dabble". 

        
         (Any of the above cohorts could be any of the below and we wouldn't really know due to the level of privacy associated with Handshake, some are more apparent than others.)

          - - - Auction Partitipants
          
          - - - Secondary Market Buyers

          - - - Secondary Market Sellers
